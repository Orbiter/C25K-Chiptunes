# C25K-Chiptunes
A Generator for C25K Running / Workout Audio Files Using Keygen Chiptune Music

### Download from
https://github.com/Orbiter/C25K-Chiptunes

## HOW TO USE

- just put the generated audio files to your mp3 player
- instead of running with your phone and an app you can simply use a leightweight mp3 player!

## WORKOUT SCHEDULE

- the workout starts always with a 3-minute walk
- the workout ends always with a 10-minute "run or walk home"
- number in `[..]` is minutes of total run-time of that workout day
- even if the workout for all three days in one week is the same, we generate
  separate audio files because the music may differ, even if the workout time is same.

## WORKOUT SOURCE

Source of C25K workout (track 1-24) from week 01 to week 08 is inspired by
`https://github.com/roelb/Simple-C25K/blob/master/res/values/strings.xml`

this is slightly modified from the original schedule:

- smaller steps from one workout to the next one
- more variation in week 7-8
- last walk sequence in the last period (if any) is omitted
- the 5K goal is reached within eight weeks instead of nine

The C210K workout is inspired by various internet sources.


## MUSIC SOURCE

The workout is enriched with music taken from keygen and chiptune sources:
`https://github.com/sxiii/keygen-music.git` and
`http://ftp.pigwa.net/stuff/mirror/chiptunes.org/chiptunes-full-000825.tar.gz`

The selection of the tracks from those collections is inspired by
`https://infinitode.prineside.com/`
which obviously uses also the same chiptune source.
